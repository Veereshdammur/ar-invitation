Creating an AR-based wedding invitation that displays a static image upon scanning a QR code is an innovative way to engage your guests. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you build and deploy this application using AR.js:

1. Set Up Your Development Environment

Install Node.js and npm: Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system to manage dependencies and run a local server.

Set Up a Local Server: AR.js requires a secure context (HTTPS) to access the camera. You can use tools like http-server to serve your project locally.

bash
Copy code
npm install -g http-server
2. Create the AR Application

Structure Your Project: Organize your project with the following structure:

arduino
Copy code
ar-wedding-invitation/
├── index.html
├── assets/
│   ├── marker.patt
│   └── invitation-image.jpg
└── js/
    └── main.js
Develop the HTML File: In index.html, set up the basic structure and include the necessary libraries:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>AR Wedding Invitation</title>
  <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AR-js-org/AR.js/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js"></script>
</head>
<body style="margin: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <a-scene embedded arjs>
    <a-marker type="pattern" url="assets/marker.patt">
      <a-image src="assets/invitation-image.jpg" position="0 0 0" rotation="-90 0 0" height="1" width="1"></a-image>
    </a-marker>
    <a-entity camera></a-entity>
  </a-scene>
</body>
</html>
This code sets up an A-Frame scene with AR.js integration, defining a marker that, when recognized, displays the invitation image.

3. Generate a Custom Marker

Create a Marker Pattern: Use the AR.js Marker Training tool to generate a custom marker pattern (marker.patt).

Design the Physical Marker: Incorporate the generated marker into your wedding invitation design, ensuring it's prominently placed for easy scanning.

4. Test the Application Locally

Run the Local Server: Navigate to your project directory and start the server:

bash
Copy code
http-server -S -C path/to/ssl/cert -K path/to/ssl/key
Access the Application: Open https://localhost:8080 in your browser, grant camera permissions, and test the AR functionality by displaying the physical marker to your camera.

5. Deploy the Application Online

Host on GitHub Pages: Initialize a Git repository in your project directory, commit your files, and push to a new repository on GitHub.

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ar-wedding-invitation.git
git push -u origin main
Enable GitHub Pages: In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the "Pages" section and select the main branch as the source. Your application will be available at https://yourusername.github.io/ar-wedding-invitation/.

6. Create a QR Code for Easy Access

Generate the QR Code: Use a QR code generator to create a code that links directly to your deployed application URL.

Include the QR Code in Invitations: Add the QR code to your physical wedding invitations, allowing guests to scan it and view the AR experience.
